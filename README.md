## Dataset
This project contains five datasets: ADNI, ADNI_fMRI, FTD_fMRI, OCD_fMRI, PPMI. Each dataset corresponds to the activity of different brain regions (blood oxygen levels in brain regions, etc.) in patients with the corresponding brain disease (Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) and in normal people
## ProjectI
This folder contains the optimal machine learning algorithms corresponding to the five datasets. For example, there are SVM, XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, MLP.

## ProjectII
This folder contains the optimal multimodal representation learning model based on CNN (ResNet, DenseNet) and RNN(LSTM, GRU), corresponding to the five datasets.
